# Wallmart's e-commerce

OBJECTIVE :
To gain insights into the performance of the store and identify opportunities for improvement. We need to identify patterns in the data in terms of customer segments, product categories, sales etc. We will do some basic Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to explore the data and will take the help of excel functiosn and features to  draw meaningful conclusions. Through this project, we hope to provide valuable insights that can help the store optimize its operations and drive growth.
